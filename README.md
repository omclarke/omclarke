# Hello I'm Olijoh M. Clarke,
a New York native, and  Army veteran currently residing in North Carolina. 

  I'm  an entry-level Data Analyst, making a career change from 10+ years working in various roles, as a Pharmacy Technician, ranging from retail to wholesale, inpatient, instructing, and sales. Also a recently separated Airborne Military Police Veteran. I've completed a **'Data Analytics Immersion Bootcamp'** at Thinkful. Over the past four months, I learned Excel (Pivots, Formulas, Visualization, Analysis, Statistics) SQL, Python(Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn), data cleaning, data querying and Tableau. During this 50+ hours a week course, I've also completed 3 Capstone projects as well a working on some for my own portfolio.  Along side that I've learned how to use PowerBI, as I noticed its another industry standard that would be good to add to my skillset. Currently a student at Thomas Edison State University for Mathematics and Data Science as I continue to progress in my career.
  
  âš¡ Fun fact: I love biking, cars, drawing, writing, cooking, and cinema. And I increase employee morale by 52.3%  

In this overview I will be updating my portfolio, projects and webpage.

  Completed exploratory data analysis to identify strategic scenarios to increase revenue, assessed by KPI 
performance and solutions to increase profits while lowering operating costs for the next fiscal year. In process of this data, I cleaned the data, and separated profits down to location. The locations were focused areas based around airports and non airport locations. 
  A key, action that was implemented in this project, I removed all products that had a net negative return, increasing profits of the company by 270K. Before implementing any further strategies. 
  
  ##### Further Analysis
> At the end of the analysis, I've come to realize the data collected on the customers wasn't sufficient enough create better strategies.  
> Such as, customer IDs, to track how many repeat customers are apart of the income the company makes, and how we can capitilize on thes repeat customers. 
> A further analysis I want to conduct: Some customers crash the vehicles, and how does this impact the company.

  In this scenario, I analyzed a Fuel Economy Data set provided by Fueleconomy.gov
  After reviewing the data, it was previously cleaned so I was able to go straight into analyizing and creating pivot tables, filtering on providing information requiring the findings to the consultation firm. 
  In the analysis, the focus was on the annual fuel cost, in this case I focused on vehicle classes (Compact, Medium and Large)
  I conducted T-Test to find the differences between the classes.
  In addition from the results of the vehicle classes, I conducted a further analysis of the transmission type of the most cost effective vehicle class. 
  
  
  #### Further Analysis
 > Conduct statistical analysis on alternative fuel types, and annual fuel costs.
 > Conduct electric vehicle effiency vs. hybrid vehicles 
 > Which company provides the most fuel effective vehicles.

  Unlike the stock market, where each stock has some correlation, it can be easily a result of causation as the markets are driven by emotion and speculation. In the Foreign exchange markets its based off a correlation as the prices of each currency is in relation to another. i.e. the USD value increases but in relation to another currency. In this analysis, we compare each pair, to another pair, which we find correlations of these pairs with in both positive and negatively.
