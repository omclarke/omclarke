**`Data Analyst`**

I'm an entry-level Data Analyst, making a career change from 10+ years working in various roles, as a Pharmacy Technician, and a recently separated Airborne Military Police Veteran. Completed a Data Analytics Immersion Bootcamp at Thinkful over the past Four months, I learned Excel (Pivots, Formulas, Visualization, Analysis, Statistics) SQL, Python(Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn), and Tableau. During this 50+ a week courses, I've also completed 3 Capstone projects as well a working on some for my own portfolio.  Along side that I've learned how to use PowerBI, as I noticed its another industry standard that would be good to add to my skillset.

In this overview I will be updating my Portfolio working on projects and webpage.
